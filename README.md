# Algorithm Visualization Suite

This project demonstrates Binary Search and Merge Sort with interactive
CLI visualizations and simple application demos. Files included:

- `main.py` — Program entry point and menus
- `binary_search.py` — Binary Search implementation and helper
- `merge_sort.py` — Merge Sort implementation
- `visualizer.py` — CLI visualization utilities
- `applications.py` — Simple demos and use-cases

Run `python3 main.py` from this folder to start the CLI application.

Notes:
- The demo visualization uses blocking `input()` calls to step through
  processes; this is intended for educational use in a terminal.
- Optional enhancements: timing, matplotlib GUI, pytest unit tests.
